Hey hii! Let me first welcome you to my portfolio page.
As you can see with this page I am more of a commandline person, I like doing things more in CLI way than using GUI.
Currently I am employeed at Capgemini, and am working here as Automation Engineer with 1.5+ years of experience.
I have been doing Python since my college days and its like my goto language if want to develope anything.
I work on servers daily and have a good experience with them, I have knowledege about SUSE servers, ESxi Hosts, their administrations patching, upgrading.
I have knowledge about Docker, git,Powershell and various different tools like this. Basically I just try to learn different things and try to know how the world works.
I will be updating more about my skills and experiences over here, so feel free to come and check on this site again.
